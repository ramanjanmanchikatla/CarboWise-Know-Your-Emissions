# 🚗 CarboWise – CO₂ Emission Estimator

EcoPredictor is a machine learning-powered application that predicts the CO₂ emission (g/km) of a vehicle based on engine size, fuel consumption, and fuel type. It uses a trained linear regression model for prediction and integrates a Groq LLM via LangChain to explain the result and answer follow-up questions in natural language.

## 🔧 Features
- Predict CO₂ emissions from vehicle specifications
- AI-powered explanation of emission factors
- Interactive Q&A for emission reduction tips
- Built with Streamlit and LangChain + Groq

## 🛡️ Tech Stack
- Python · Scikit-learn · Streamlit
- LangChain · Groq LLM (deepseek / llama3)
